\section{ Question 1 }\label{sec:q1} 
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item
False. A ballistic entry is characterised by zero lift (reader p. 218)
\item True. Drag goes up along with the nose radius, so the lift to drag ratio decreases.
\item True. The large angle of attack at the beginning of entry is used to minimize heating rates and deceleration. Therefore it should follow a shallow path during descent (large angle of attack) (reader p. 254)
\item False. The minimum is 1 unit axis rotation. (reader p.195 onwards)
\item False.
\item True. In the exponential atmosphere model the temperature is constant wrt altitude. Since the speed of sound is dependent on the temperature, as altitude increases, the speed of sound remains constant. (reader p.28)
\item( True. at least 4 satellites are needed to determine the position. (reader p.393)
\item False. This only holds for linear systems (reader 330 - 333)
\item True. Reefing slows down the opening of a parachute. (reader p.422)
\item False. For both entry flights the mechanical loads occur after the maximum heat flux. (reader p.323-324 figure 5-70, 5-71) and (reader p239 figure 5.16)
